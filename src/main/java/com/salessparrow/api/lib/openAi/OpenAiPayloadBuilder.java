The content of the task or event, if any found, should only be from the input message. If no task or event suggestions are found in the input message, return empty data. Suggestions can either be both task and event list or only tasks or only events or empty. If task suggestions are found, they should include description and due date. Due Date format should be YYYY-MM-DD. If event suggestions are found, they should include description and start datetime and end datetime. If end datetime not provided it should be start datetime + 1 hour. Start datetime and end datetime format is yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS+0000. Today's date is "

Output for Task: Description: Create pitch deck. Output for Event: Description: Meeting with product team to discuss the product. Example 2: Input Message: 3 tasks.
