```

### src/

This directory is where you will typically store your source code files. It contains Java classes, packages, and other resources that make up your application. This is where you'll implement your business logic, controllers, services, data access code, and more.

### pom.xml

It contains configuration and dependency information for your project. You define project details, dependencies, build settings, and other configurations here. Maven uses this file to manage your project's build, dependencies, and other aspects.

### README.md

This is a Markdown file that usually contains important information about your project. It gives an overview of your project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and any other relevant details.


### docs/

This directory serves as a submodule linked to [ai-salesparrow-docs](https://github.com/TrueSparrowSystems/AI-SalesSparrow-docs) repository that holds comprehensive documentation for the project. Instead of duplicating documentation within the main repository, this submodule approach allows you to maintain documentation separately, ensuring consistency and easier management.
